# Bootcampers: Interactive Full-Stack Application

Our main concept for this website was a space for Bootcamp Graduates and potential hiring managers to meet. We curated the website to be geared towards the companires browsing through resumes/portfolios. In phase one we were able to implement authentication via login/sign up forms for the companies where they can view all the cohort graduates and post an open positions. 

For the graduates we have them a space on the website to upload their resumes/portfolio links and a way to view any open position posts created by propestive employeers. 

In Phase 1 of our project you will be able to see authentication, GET/POST routes for both companies and graduates(applicants)

## Technologies

* Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

* Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.

* Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

## Phase2 and Beyond!

* User Routing after Authentication in Handlebars: One geared for companies and another for the graduates.

* Graduates will be able to apply to a job posting

* Creating a more detailed forms for job postings, resume profile, and user profile that will streamline the tables a lot more. Create a master user that then funnels to other secitons of the website based on their 'role'. 

* Build out the 'View All applicants' handlebars/table/data so that we are able to see more than just basic information. Ideally would be able to see a full portfolio like profile for each graduate.

* Revise the UI/UX
